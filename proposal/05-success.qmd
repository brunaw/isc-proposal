# Success
<!--
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a
thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery
-->

## Definition of done
<!--
What does success look like?
-->

The final book should be:

- fully compiled without problems, 
- with all examples made in `R` following the same logic as the already available code, 
- available in a GitHub repository for reproducibility,
- publicized via posts on Linkedin, Slack groups and other relevant places. 

## Measuring success
<!--
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use
along the way
-->

Progress and success can be measured using the following criteria:

**Technical completion:**  

  - All chapters compile correctly.  
  - All code examples run without errors and produce the expected output.  

**Quality checks:**  

  - Peer review or internal review confirms clarity, consistency, and correctness.  
  - Consistent formatting, style, and referencing across chapters.  

**Repository readiness:**  

  - Repository is public, documented, and versioned.  


**Community engagement:**  

  - At least a few announcements/posts are made across agreed channels.
  - Initial feedback from early readers is collected and documented.  

**Impact markers (longer-term):**  

  - Number of stars, forks, or issues on GitHub after release.  
  - Reader engagement via comments, shares, or contributions.   

## Future work
<!--
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself
and/or the community in general?
-->

This work can be extended by providing the same code
"translation" to different language versions of the book, which
already exist but only for `python`. In addition, we also think
of creating a Shiny App where the book readers can play with the
code and its results, which can be easily done after the `R` code
is provided.
