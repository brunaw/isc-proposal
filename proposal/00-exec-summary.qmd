# Executive Summary

<!--
This section provides a condensed view of the entire proposal, one page long.
It should be a comprehensive high-level overview that captures the essence of the proposal, including its goals, methods, expected outcomes, deliverables, and budget.
-->

The book called "Causal Inference for The Brave and True", by 
Matheus Facure, is an engaging yet methodical approach to causality, and it has become a good reference to anyone learning this topic in the most recent days. The same author also wrote [@facure2023causal]. 


## Goals

The main goal of this proposal is to provide a translation of the
current `python` code of the book "Causal Inference for The Brave and True"  into `R` code. This will lead to helping
causal inference concepts accessible to `R` users in a 
friendly, simple and reproducible way. A secondary goal is to
provide the same code translation for the portuguese version of
the book, amplifying the reach of this project. 

## Methods

The full text & code used to generate the book are stored in 
an open-source repository called [matheusfacure/python-causality-handbook](https://github.com/matheusfacure/python-causality-handbook). The book is fully reproducible
and created from a set of notebook files which are rendered to
create the main file. 

Given that, our method of execution is to translate the already 
provided `python` code into `R`, and replacing it on the 
chunks of the book that use the code. 

If any file changes are necessary in order to fully compile the
`R` correctly, we will also provide that. 


## Expected Outcomes 

The main expected outcome is a version of the "Causal Inference for The Brave and True" book in which the accompanying code is written
in `R`. This will also help broaden the reach of the book to the `R` community.

## Deliverables

The deliverables can be defined as : 

- Files which compose the "Causal Inference for The Brave and True" book using `R` code instead of `python`
- Full compilation of such files in order to generate the book
- Blog/linkedin posts to communicate the creation of this book version
- Linking the new version of the book into its main homepage, helping broadening its reach into the community 

## Budget

From 4,350â€“6,150 USD, as later estimated in this report.
