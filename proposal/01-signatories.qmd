# Signatories
<!--
This section provides the ISC with a view of the support received from
the community for a proposal. Acceptance isn't predicated on
popularity but community acceptance is important. Willingness to
accept outside input is also a good marker for project delivery.

An optional section would be for R-Core signatories where changes to R
are proposed.
-->

## Project team

The single person in the project team is [Bruna Wundervald](https://github.com/brunaw). We believe one
person with both `R` & causality skills is enough to successfully
complete this project. 

<!--
Who are the people responsible for actually delivering the project if
the proposal gets accepted and are already signed up and rearing to
go? Briefly describe all participants and the skills they will bring
to the project.
-->

## Contributors
<!--
Who are the people who have actively helped with this proposal but
won't necessarily be on the core project team later?
-->

The main contributors are [Bruna Wundervald](https://github.com/brunaw), the project owner, and 
[Matheus Facure](https://github.com/matheusfacure), book
author. 

## Consulted
<!--
Who has been given the opportunity to provide feedback on the
proposal? This should include any R Consortium & ISC members who the
proposal has been discussed with.
-->

The main person who's given feedback on the proposal was
Matheus Facure. We have not consulted R Consortium & ISC
members yet, but we believe this project can be of great usefulness
to the `R` community. 

We would be very happy to receive any sort of feedback and/or
suggestions for this project.
